Unlocking Android - WindWaves
---------------------------------------------

Android application that demonstrates many Android
location related facilities and APIs. 

Gets data from the National Data Buoy Center and displays
it with a MapActivity and MapView.

NOTE: You need your own debug Google Maps API key to use this application
in the emulator. If you don't already have a key you can get one by following the 
instructions here (more instructions in the book too):
http://code.google.com/android/toolbox/apis/mapkey.html#getfingerprint.     

Once you have the key you must set it in res/layout/mapview_activity.xml.

Tested with 1.1 and 1.5.
